# Girls-Of-Color-Coding-Curriculum

Girls of color are highly underrepresented in Computer Science – let’s change those statistics and reach as many girls of 
color as possible around the world and introduce them to coding. 

This repository is intended as a gathering place for educators
researchers, and students from around the world to develop a collaborative curriculum as an open-source online project. 

Together we can contribute our ideas, test cases, and feedback so we can reach girls of color and get them excited about learning
how to code, and sharing what they learn with their friends and community.
